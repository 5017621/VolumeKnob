# VolumeKnob #

When listening to music at work I find it really annoying to adjust the volume in my OS. Having seen a bunch of projects where they build an external volume knob, I thought why not make my own. I bought a couple off digispark clones a while ago and these seem the perfect solution for this. Add a rotary encoder plus a fancy knob and you have all the parts. I followed the [adafruit tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/trinket-usb-volume-knob) (they use a trinket, essentially the same as a digispark) and made some changes to the code. 

I now have the following controls using my know:
* Single click: Pause/Play
* Double click: Mute
* Turn: Volume
* Hold and turn right: Next track
* Hold and turn left: Previous track

Now that the hardware worked I needed a case for it. In Amsterdam, where I live, there is a makerspace [ZB45](https://zb45.nl/) where on Tuesdays you can use the laser cutter (and other stuff) for free. So that is what I used. I used it before to make a case for my [WiFi Enabled Traffic Light](https://zb45.nl/node/128), but this time I wanted the case round, so I came up with the following drawing.

I cut all the parts a couple off times and in two different thicknesses, ±3mm and ±5mm. Then I went home and started putting the puzzle together.

I ended up with the following configuration (bottom to top):
* 1 in 3mm
* 2 in 3mm
* 2 in 5mm
* 2 in 3mm
* 4 in 3mm
* 5 in 3mm

Next version needs to be heavier, or maybe I will add some lead pellets in this version, there is room for it in the bottom layers.
